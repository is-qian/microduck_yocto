# Runs the real in-container body (extracted from build-hfjob.sh) five times in
# the kas image, against a tmpfs /cache and a fake `kas` that adds one sstate
# object per "job". Checks the archive protocol: a legacy sstate.tar pair is
# read and replaced, the pointer is followed, superseded archives go, a corrupt
# one is refused, and the archive a concurrent reader started from survives the
# next publish -- the race that cost two 35-minute reseeds.
