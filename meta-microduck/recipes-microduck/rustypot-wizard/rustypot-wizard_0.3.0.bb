SUMMARY = "TUI configurator for Dynamixel and Feetech servos"
DESCRIPTION = "rustypot_wizard, Pollen's servo setup tool: scan a bus, read and \
write registers, change IDs and baud rates. On the robot it talks to the motor \
bus at /dev/ttyS2, which the microduck account reaches through dialout; stop \
robotd first, since it holds the port."

# The release's own prebuilt aarch64 binary (cargo-dist), not a build from
# source: it links only libc (GLIBC_2.34, wrynose has newer) and libgcc_s, and
# the binary every other user of the tool runs is the one worth having here.
# Pinned by version and checksum; v0.3.0 is the tag at 7174ddc9.
