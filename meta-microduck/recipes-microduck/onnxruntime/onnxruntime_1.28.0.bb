SUMMARY = "ONNX Runtime, Microsoft's prebuilt aarch64 shared library"
DESCRIPTION = "Needed by robotd's gait policy. duck-control depends on ort \
2.0.0-rc.11 with the \"load-dynamic\" feature, so the library is dlopened at first \
use rather than linked -- robotd installs and starts fine without it and only fails \
when asked to walk."

# The prebuilt release, which is what microduck_daemon's scripts/setup-board.sh
# fetches. Building ONNX Runtime from source needs protobuf, abseil, onnx and a long
# CMake build, and there is no oe-core recipe for it -- not worth it for a library we
# only dlopen.
#
# Version: the workspace pins [workspace.metadata.onnxruntime] floor = "1.23",
# target = "1.28.0". The floor exists because a board once shipped 1.20.1 against an
# `ort` that panics below 1.23, so keep this at or above the floor and in step with
# the `ort` dependency.

# `install` and plain `cp -R` create root-owned files instead, and the symlink chain

	# A second unversioned symlink, in /usr/local/lib, purely so the daemon's
	# update hook can find this.
	#
	# hooks/preinstall probes exactly one path -- ONNX_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/lib --
	# and reads the version out of what `readlink -f` resolves to, because asking
	# the library itself would mean dlopening it. A distro install in ${libdir} is
	# invisible to that check, so on 2026-09-16 a board carrying this very package
	# at the very version the hook wanted refused the 0.13.0 update with "ONNX
	# Runtime absent is below 1.23" and then failed to download a replacement
	# because the image has no curl. The update was correctly refused and nothing
	# was swapped; it just could never have succeeded.
	#
	# Pointing at the versioned file rather than at ${libdir}/libonnxruntime.so
	# keeps the hook's parse working through one hop instead of three, and means
	# this link says which version it is even if the chain above changes shape.
	#
	# The hook writes here itself when it does install ONNX, so this is the
	# directory it already owns -- we are only telling it what is already present.

# The unversioned symlink has to be in the RUNTIME package, which is not where Yocto
# would put it. duck-control/src/policy.rs dylib_name() replicates ort's own lookup:
# with ORT_DYLIB_PATH unset it dlopens plain "libonnxruntime.so", so shipping that
# symlink in -dev would leave robotd unable to load the policy on a normal image.
# Hence FILES below, and the dev-so QA skip that permits it.

# GLIBC_2.27 (checked with `strings | grep GLIBC_`), well below wrynose's glibc, so
