SUMMARY = "GStreamer plugins written in Rust: webrtcsink/webrtcsrc and rtp"
DESCRIPTION = "The plugin reachy_mini_os ships as an 82.7 MB Git-LFS blob with no \
recipe, no source pin and four environment variables duplicated into every systemd \
unit to locate it. Built here from a pinned SRCREV, which is the clearest single \
argument for the whole Yocto trade."

# Six repositories, and everything after the first is the difficulty of this recipe.
#
# gst-plugins-rs takes its bindings from git rather than crates.io:
#
#   gst = { package = "gstreamer",
#           git = "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs",
#           branch = "0.25", version = "0.25.0" }
#
# and cargo-update-recipe-crates only vendors crates.io entries --
#
#   crates_candidates = list(filter(lambda c: 'crates.io' in c.get('source', ''), ...))
#
# -- so none of those crates reaches the generated crates.inc and cargo cannot
# resolve them under --frozen. Every 1.28.x tag (1.28.0 .. 1.28.6) does this, which
# is why no upstream Yocto recipe for gst-plugins-rs exists.
#
# There are five such repositories, not one. The first attempt fetched only
# gstreamer-rs and still failed, on `glib` from gtk-rs-core, because **cargo
# resolves the entire workspace even when --package names two members**: the error
# came from gst-plugin-analytics, which we do not build. Resolution needs every
# member's sources present; compilation still only touches what we ask for, so
# gtk4-rs and the rest are fetched and never built.
#
# Each SRCREV below is the commit gst-plugins-rs's own Cargo.lock pins, not the tip
# of the branch it names. A tip would build a combination upstream never resolved
# and would differ between two builds of the same SRCREV_plugins. Extract them with:
#
#   grep -oE 'git\+[^"]+#[0-9a-f]{40}' Cargo.lock | sort -u

# No S assignment. oe-core's bitbake.conf sets S = "${UNPACKDIR}/${BP}" and
# BB_GIT_DEFAULT_DESTSUFFIX = "${BP}", so the gst-plugins-rs checkout -- the one
# without an explicit destsuffix -- already lands exactly there. Setting
# S = "${UNPACKDIR}/git" by hand is now a hard do_unpack error rather than a
# harmless leftover, which is how this recipe failed its first build.
#
# Every other checkout carries a destsuffix and so lands beside S, named after the
# repository, which is the convention the postfunc below relies on.

# cargo_c drives `cargo cbuild`/`cargo cinstall` and pulls cargo-c-native itself.
# net/webrtc/Cargo.toml already carries [package.metadata.capi] with

# Three of 65 workspace members. Building the whole repo would be hundreds of crates
# of plugins nothing here needs. gst-plugin-rtp comes along because the webrtc
# plugin's payloading path uses it. gst-plugin-tracers (buffer-lateness,
# queue-levels, pipeline-snapshot, pad-push-timings, memory-tracer, pcap-writer)
# is pure Rust -- every crate it pulls is already in crates.inc, since Cargo.lock
# covers the whole workspace -- and lands in its own package for the dev image.

# Point cargo at the fetched checkouts, one [patch] entry per crate.
#
# cargo_common_do_patch_paths already does this for git dependencies, but it can only
# express *one crate per repository*: it reads `name` and `destsuffix` off each SRC_URI
# entry and emits `name = { path = <UNPACKDIR>/<destsuffix> }`. These repositories hold
# 70 crates between them -- gstreamer-rs alone has 39, each in its own subdirectory and
# some nested two deep (gstreamer/sys, gstreamer-gl/egl/sys). One entry per repository
# cannot name them, and adding a repository once per crate would clone it that many
# times and still point every entry at its root.
#
# So the class writes six useless entries and this function replaces the lot. Their
# names are not wasted: giving those SRC_URI entries both `name` and `destsuffix` is
# what makes the class do the other half of its job, which we do want -- stripping the
# `source = "git..."` lines out of Cargo.lock so --frozen still passes, after keeping
# the .orig copy this function reads.
#
# Nothing here is hand-maintained. The repositories, their crate names and the [patch]
# keys all come from the lockfile; the paths come from walking the checkouts. A bumped
# SRCREV that moves or renames a crate is then a build failure that names it, rather
# than a patch that silently does not apply -- which is the failure this area has
# already produced once, in the v3 binary release whose MANIFEST claims a patch its
# .so does not contain.
